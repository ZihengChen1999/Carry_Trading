1. Rebalancing method

To implement the carry trading using asset_1 and asset_2, I open positions of new asset_2 using close price of the first day we use the new pair of contracts,
and I close positions using the close price of the last day we were using the old pair of contracts. 

So, we do not hold positions the first day we change pair of contracts, and we hold the positions for around one month, and rebalance before and after we change contract pairs.

2. Signal Construction

Alpha signals are the rolling Z-score of asset_2_close/asset_1_close. Multiple hyperparameters for the rollingw windows are used.


3. Bet Sizing

I assumed that I have a free capital of 10M, and I would risk more when my signal is stronger.

If Z-score is [0.5, 1], I will risk 1% of my free capital to short asset_2
If Z-score is [1, 2], I will risk 3% of my free capital to short asset_2
If Z-score is [2, x], I will risk 6% of my free capital to short asset_2
When the Z score is smaller than 0, I will go long, but the bet size is the same as the above

4. Performance Summary

Dollar return, dollar std, dollar maimum drawdown and sharpe ratios are calculated for different hyperparameters and are evaluated both in-sample and out-of-sample. 

In-sample peiord is from 2000 to 2014, and from 2014 to 2023 are out-of-sample period.

The summary statistics are in the file test_strategy_performance.csv and train_strategy_performance.csv and the total PnL are plotted under folder plots.
